- Existing-object immutable fields are preserved by the system. URI identity fields may be
  updated when their schema allows it; changing one renames the memory object.
- If a rename target already exists, do not rename over it. Read both objects, update the
  canonical target with every distinct fact, then delete the source with replacement=target.
- delete() removes the whole object; use obj.content.drop(text=...) (with the real field name) when only some content must go and the rest stays.
- For canonical merges, use duplicate.delete(replacement=canonical); for pure deletes, call delete() without replacement.
- delete(replacement=canonical) discards the duplicate's content entirely and keeps only the canonical. Before deleting a duplicate, first fold every distinct valid fact it holds into the canonical (e.g. canonical.content.edit(...)); merging or compacting must never drop a unique fact that only the duplicate recorded.
